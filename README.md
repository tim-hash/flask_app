# flask_blog

A web app based on flask to create a basic blog.

This app allowed me to gain insights at web development using python and the micro framework flask.

The features of the app includes: Account creation, updating of email, password reset via a one time token sent by email, post publication, edition and deletion.

This app is based on the YouTube tutorials from Corey Schaffer.
